# Quadtree Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a quadtree data structure. A quadtree is a tree-based spatial partitioning technique commonly used for efficient spatial indexing and querying of 2D data.

## Features
- Efficiently stores and organizes 2D data points or objects in a hierarchical structure.
- Supports spatial queries such as point insertion, deletion, and range searches.
- Provides efficient retrieval of objects within specified rectangular regions.
- Implements dynamic resizing and node splitting to handle varying densities of data.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Include the necessary Quadtree library files in your project.
3. Create an instance of the Quadtree data structure.
4. Insert data points or objects into the quadtree using the provided insertion function.
5. Perform queries, such as range searches or nearest neighbor searches, using the appropriate query functions.
6. Optionally, customize the quadtree parameters to suit your specific needs, such as maximum node capacity or minimum node size.
