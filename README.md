# CS201-Project

Compile the code by using gcc quadtree.c and execute by typing ./a.out if in linux or mac and ./a.exe if in windows

The code will ask you to enter the Centre or Origin of the x-y plane point
i.e. first it will ask for x coordinate then y respectively

Then it will ask for the length of the square plane 
if you want x and y coordinate from -5 to 5 and if the center is 0,0 then press 10

Then it will ask for number of points you want to insert

Then it will ask for the location of the car in the region, here you need to enter the postion of the car 
After that we need to enter the region around the car in which you want to see the objects around the car

FINALLY you will get all the objects present around the car in the user defined region 

PRECAUTION
If you enter the point which not lies in the region then it will not store in the quadtree

Thanks
